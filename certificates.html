                as part of a school project, i gave a presentation on the topic of conflicts. I discussed what conflicts are, presented the results
                of my research, and share the methods i had selected for resolving conflicts. i also introduced activities that help raise awareness amon teenagers
                about how to deal with conflicts. 
                i presented my findings to the school`s academic staff and teachers. i became one of the winners and recived a certificate!
